# TransferSaldoGo

## Description
This project is a microservice which serve transaction service in a sandbox using virtual wallet. There are 2 API's in this service : one of those is a GET API to get user balance data and the other one is POST API to do transactions. There is 2 dummy data in this project ready to be used. 

## Tools
* Go Programming Language
* MongoDB Atlas Database
* MinGW for running Shell Setup Script (for Windows user)
* Docker for Virtualization

# Features
### GET balance API
This API is used to get user balance data from Database
```
curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/account/{account_number}'
```
### Response
```
{
    "code": 200,
    "message": "Success",

# Initialize
This project do not serve any data assets for you anymore. So you'll need to create data in your own mongoDB database. There are minimal 2 several table in your dataset, you can copy dataset below :
## Customer Dataset

| Customer Number | Name 
| :---: | :---: |
| Bob Martin | 555001 |
| Linus Torvalds | 555002 |

## Account Dataset

| Account Number | Customer Number | Balance |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 555001 | 1001 | 10000 |
| 555002 | 1002 | 15000 |


# Usage
This server can be executed by 4 ways :
1. Manually from project folder
2. Manually by docker
3. Automatically using docker compose file 
4. Automatically using Makefile

## 1. Manually from project folder
First thing first we have to install all of the dependencies by typing this command in terminal :
```
    go mod tidy
```
and then we are ready to execute the server by this following command :
```
    go run main.go
```
or we can simply just use Makefile by this following command :
```
    make gorun
```

## 2. Manually by docker
First we must have docker installed in our PC. Then we have to build the docker image by using the following command :
```
    docker build --tag kabdi384/transfersaldo:beta .
```
OR we can just use image I've uploaded to docker hub public repository by using the following command : 
```
    docker pull kabdi384/transfersaldo:beta
```
After we finished building our application, we are now able to build the container by using the following command :
```
docker container create --name transfersaldo-container -p 8080:8080 -e SERVER_PORT=8080 -e MONGO_DB=TransferSaldo -e MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/" -e CORS_HEADER=x-api-key,Authorization,Content-Type,Origin,Accept,Access-Control-Allow-Headers,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers,Access-Control-Allow-Origin -e CORS_METHOD=OPTION,GET,PUT,POST,DELETE -e CORS_ORIGIN='*' kabdi384/transfersaldo:beta
```
And then we can start our container by using this following command:
```
    docker container start transfersaldo-container
```
## 3. Automatically using docker-compose file
First we have to build/pull docker image according to the instructions above. After we have docker image in our computer, we can simply run this command on our project folder : 
```
    docker-compose up -d
```
After this command, our server is started and ready to use.
## 4. Automatically using Makefile
We can build, create and run container simply by using Makefile. If you are a windows user, you should be installing MinGW first. For Linux and user, simply follow this command :
```
    make docker
```
for windows user, after installing MinGW. Please copy the following command and run it in your command promp:
```
    mingw32-make docker
```

# Unit Testing
This project already contain some test unit for usecases's functions. There are 2 different ways to test this projects:

1. Manual test
2. Automatically using Makefile

## 1. Manual Test
Manual it means we have to go to test directory manually by changing directory to usecases using this following command:
```
    cd src/usecases/
```
and then we can start execute unit testing by using command :
```
    go test
```
## 2. Automatically using Makefile
We can simply test our application by using the following command :
```
    make gorun
```
